# Telegram Bot with ChatGPT

 I create a simple bot that works on Cloudflare workers and handles users messages with ChatGPT.

 - Wrangler: CLI for Cloudflare Workers
 - Telegram bot API
 - OpenAI API

 I deploy my code to Cloudflare and open a domain that will be attached to my worker. It triggers a request to Telegram to set the domain as handler for user requests to the bot. Also it send bot commands that will be available for users. Finally we'll be able to use my bot.
