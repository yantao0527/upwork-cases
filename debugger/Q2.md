## What is the difference between a mock and a stub in unit testing?

In unit testing, both mocks and stubs are types of test doubles, which are used to replace real objects or components in the system under test. They help to isolate the code being tested and control its interactions with external dependencies. However, mocks and stubs serve different purposes and have different behaviors:

1. Mock:
- A mock is an object that mimics the behavior of a real object and records how it is interacted with (e.g., method calls, arguments passed, etc.).
- Mocks are primarily used for behavior verification, meaning they help ensure that certain interactions or method calls with external dependencies occur as expected during the execution of the test.
- Mocks usually come with a built-in expectation mechanism that allows you to define how the mock should be interacted with and to verify whether those interactions have occurred.
- If the expected interactions do not occur, or if they happen in a different order or with different arguments, the test will fail.
2. Stub:
- A stub is an object that provides predefined responses to method calls or property accesses, replacing the actual behavior of a real object.
- Stubs are primarily used for state verification, meaning they help set up the conditions needed to test a particular piece of code by providing known responses to method calls.
- Stubs do not typically record how they are interacted with and do not enforce any expectations on how they should be called.
With stubs, the test's focus is on verifying the state of the system or the output of the code being tested, not on the interactions with the stub itself.

In summary, mocks are used to verify the behavior of your code by checking whether it interacts with external dependencies as expected, while stubs are used to set up specific conditions and provide predetermined responses to method calls, allowing you to focus on testing the state or output of your code.
