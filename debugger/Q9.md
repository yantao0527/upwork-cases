## How would you write a test case to ensure that a particular piece of code always throws an exception when given invalid input?

To write a test case that ensures a particular piece of code always throws an exception when given invalid input, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the invalid input: Determine the specific input or conditions that should cause the code to throw an exception. This might include null values, out-of-range values, improperly formatted data, or other invalid scenarios.

2. Write the test case: Create a new test case in your testing framework for the function or method that handles the input. In the test case, provide the invalid input you identified in step 1 as the argument to the function or method.

3. Test for the expected exception: Use the testing framework's built-in features or assertions to check that the expected exception is thrown when the function or method is called with the invalid input. This will typically involve using a specific assertion or construct to verify that the exception occurs.

Here's an example of how you might write a test case for a Python function using the pytest testing framework:

```
import pytest

def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Division by zero is not allowed.")
    return a / b

def test_divide_by_zero_exception():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as exc_info:
        divide(42, 0)
    assert str(exc_info.value) == "Division by zero is not allowed."
```

In this example, we have a divide function that throws a ValueError exception when attempting to divide by zero. The test_divide_by_zero_exception test case uses the pytest.raises context manager to check that the ValueError exception is thrown when calling divide(42, 0). Additionally, it verifies that the exception message matches the expected error message.

By writing test cases that check for expected exceptions when given invalid input, you can ensure that your code handles errors and edge cases correctly and that it provides informative error messages to users or other parts of your application.
